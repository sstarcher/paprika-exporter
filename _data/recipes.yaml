  directions:
  - "Preheat oven to 350\xB0F. Pour about 1 Tbsp. oil into a 9x5\" loaf pan and coat\
    \ bottom and sides with fingertips. Sprinkle granulated sugar onto sides and bottom\
    \ of pan to lightly coat."
  - Grate apples, peel and all, on the large holes of a box grater. Gather apples
    in a clean kitchen towel and wring out excess liquid. Be aggressive! You want
    them as dry as possible when they go into the batter.
  - Whisk cinnamon, pepper, cardamom, and ginger in a medium bowl. Transfer 1/4 tsp.
    spice mixture to a small bowl; set aside. Add flour and baking powder to remaining
    spice mixture and whisk to combine.
  - Whisk together eggs, egg yolks, brown sugar, vanilla, salt, and 1/2 cup granulated
    sugar in a large bowl. Continue whisking vigorously until lightened in color and
    thickened. Whisking with one hand and pouring with the other, slowly stream 1
    cup oil into egg mixture until combined. Gently fold flour mixture into whipped
    eggs with a flexible rubber spatula just until combined, taking care not to overmix.
  - Fluff up grated apples and scatter over batter. Gently fold to incorporate.
  - Transfer batter to prepared pan; smooth top. Add 2 tsp. granulated sugar to reserved
    spice mixture and mix to combine. Sprinkle spiced sugar evenly over top of batter.
  - "Bake cake until deep golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes\
    \ out clean, 60\u201370 minutes. Let cake cool in pan. Run a butter knife or offset\
    \ spatula along edge of cake to loosen and invert onto a platter."
  - 'Do Ahead: Cake can be made 3 days ahead (the flavor gets slightly more intense
    each day). Store in an airtight container at room temperature.'

  directions:
  - For best results, chill your butter in the freezer for 10-20 minutes before beginning
    this recipe. It's ideal that the butter is very cold for light, flaky, buttery
    biscuits.
  - Preheat oven to 425F and line a cookie sheet with nonstick parchment paper. Set
    aside.
  - Combine flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl and mix well. Set
    aside.
  - Remove your butter from the refrigerator and either cut it into your flour mixture
    using a pastry cutter or (preferred) use a box grater to shred the butter into
    small pieces and then add to the flour mixture and stir.
  - Cut the butter or combine the grated butter until the mixture resembles coarse
    crumbs.
  - Add milk, use a wooden spoon or spatula to stir until combined (don't over-work
    the dough).
  - Transfer your biscuit dough to a well-floured surface and use your hands to gently
    work the dough together. If the dough is too sticky, add flour until it is manageable.
  - Once the dough is cohesive, fold in half over itself and use your hands to gently
    flatten layers together. Rotate the dough 90 degrees and fold in half again, repeating
    this step 5-6 times but taking care to not overwork the dough.
  - Use your hands (do not use a rolling pin) to flatten the dough to 1" thick and
    lightly dust a 2 3/4" round biscuit cutter with flour.
  - Making close cuts, press the biscuit cutter straight down into the dough and drop
    the biscuit onto your prepared baking sheet.
  - Repeat until you have gotten as many biscuits as possible and place less than
    1/2" apart on baking sheet.
  - Once you have gotten as many biscuits as possible out of the dough, gently re-work
    the dough to get out another biscuit or two until you have at least 6 biscuits.
  - Bake on 425F for 12 minutes or until tops are beginning to just turn lightly golden
    brown.
  - If desired, brush with melted salted butter immediately after removing from oven.
    Serve warm and enjoy.

  directions:
  - Start by mixing the sourdough starter, 1 1/4 cup of water, vegetable oil, malt
    syrup, sea salt, and flours together in a bowl.
  - "Mixture will seem extremely stiff. That\u2019s ok. Just make sure all the flour\
    \ is getting hydrated. If necessary, pour that remaining 1/4 cup of water in,\
    \ if you see too much dry flour that won\u2019t incorporate into the dough."
  - Cover bowl with a damp towel and let dough sit for 10 minutes.
  - 'Kneading: I would recommend a stand mixer to knead this dough. Or a lot of elbow
    grease.'
  - "Bagel dough should be kneaded at least 7 minutes by machine, probably double\
    \ by hand. And it\u2019s a very stiff dough, so it\u2019s not the easiest to knead."
  - "It\u2019s very important that you knead this dough properly, so the bagels will\
    \ have their proper texture and gluten development."
  - At the end of kneading, dough should be smooth, but still pretty stiff and dense.
  - Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl.
  - Cover with a damp towel.
  - Let it rise in a warm place for about 4 hours.
  - If your place is cold, let it rise 5 hours.
  - Transfer dough to the counter.
  - I split mine into 100 g (3.5 oz.) pieces, and ended up with 14 pieces.
  - Turn pieces into balls by rolling them against the counter, with your hand in
    a cup shape.
  - Use the counter to push the dough against itself and turn into a perfect round.
  - "There are plenty of videos on youtube that show this technique properly. Very\
    \ easy, and you\u2019ll always end up with perfectly shaped rolls, bagels."
  - "Now that you\u2019ve rolled all the pieces into balls, start by making a hole\
    \ in the center of each ball with your finger. Expand the center out with your\
    \ hands, by rotating the bagel as you shape the hole in the middle."
  - Check pics above to see how I did it.
  - Then, place bagels in 2 baking mat or parchment paper lined baking sheets.
  - I put 7 bagels in each baking sheet.
  - Cover both trays with a damp towel. Let them sit at room temperature for 1-2 hours.
  - Once the dough is springing back as you touch it, means your bagels are ready
    to go.
  - Pre-heat oven to 425F.
  - Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
  - Once water comes to a boil, add baking soda to the pot.
  - Boil bagels in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan.
  - "You should boil bagels about 20 seconds on each side. I don\u2019t like to boil\
    \ them over 1 min total, or their crust might turn out too hard."
  - Remove bagels with a slotted spoon after they have boiled about 20 seconds on
    each side.
  - "Place boiled bagels in a baking sheet, lined with parchment paper or a silicon\
    \ mat, and sprinkled with semolina/cornmeal, if you\u2019d like."
  - Brush bagels with milk.
  - "Sprinkle with whatever seasoning of your preference. I used sesame seeds, poppy\
    \ seeds, dried onions, dried garlic, coarse sea salt, and even some Za\u2019atar\
    \ I had in my spice cupboard. Za\u2019atar is a tangy spice blend you will love,\
    \ once you try it."
  - I just keep it in a shaker, and shake on top of toasts and other savory goodies.
  - After sprinkling your bagels with the seasoning, place trays in the oven.
  - Bake for about 10 minutes. Rotate pans. Bake for another 5-15 minutes. It will
    really depend on your oven and what size bagels you decided to make.
  - "Once bagels have a deep golden color, remove them from the oven. Let them cool\
    \ and enjoy them fresh.\LSTORAGE: I like to enjoy the bagels when they are very\
    \ fresh. That\u2019s when they are the best. However, nothing wrong with leftover\
    \ bagel toast in the morning. Keep bagels in an air-tight container for up to\
    \ a couple of days, I wouldn\u2019t go longer than that. You can also freeze them\
    \ wrapped in foil and inside of a ziplock bag or freezer container for up to 2\
    \ months."

    Bagels.'

  directions:
  - 'To make the dough: Mix together all the dough ingredients except the salt (and
    optional yeast) until the flour is evenly moistened and the dough has formed a
    cohesive, sticky mass, 2 to 3 minutes on low speed of a stand mixer.'
  - Add the salt (and yeast) on top of the dough (without mixing it in), then cover
    and let the dough rest for 20 minutes. This rest is period is known as an autolyse.
  - "After the autolyse, mix in the salt (and yeast) until fully incorporated, about\
    \ 1 minute on low speed. Turn the mixer up one speed and knead the dough until\
    \ it\u2019s smooth and supple though still somewhat soft and tacky, about 2 to\
    \ 3 minutes."
  - "Cover the dough and let it rest in a warm (75\xB0F) place for 4 hours. To develop\
    \ strength in the dough, stretch and fold it in the bowl three to four times during\
    \ the rest. You can be fairly flexible in your timing of these. One stretch and\
    \ fold per hour is ideal. The goal is to end up with a strong dough with good\
    \ elasticity."
  - 'To make the filling: Meanwhile, combine all the filling ingredients in a medium
    bowl. The texture will be somewhat like wet sand.'
  - "Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased or floured work surface and gently\
    \ deflate it, patting or rolling it into a 14\u201D x 20\u201D rectangle."
  - "Spread the filling evenly over the surface of the dough, leaving 1/2\u201D of\
    \ exposed dough along one short edge."
  - Starting with the filling-coated short edge, roll the dough into a log. As you
    roll, the log will lengthen to around 18".
  - "Cut the log into twelve 1 1/2\u201D slices and place them in a lightly greased\
    \ 9\u201D x 13\u201D pan. Cover the pan and let the buns rise until they\u2019\
    re puffy, 2 to 3 hours."
  - At this point, you can let the buns rise for another hour or so and then bake
    them; or you can place the pan in the refrigerator overnight, covered, and bake
    the buns the next day (up to 24 hours later).
  - "To bake the same day: Bake the buns in a preheated 400\xB0F oven for 18 to 22\
    \ minutes, until golden. A digital thermometer inserted into the center of a middle\
    \ bun should read 190\xB0F."
  - 'To make the icing: While the buns are baking, stir together all the ingredients
    in a medium bowl until smooth.'
  - "Remove the buns from the oven and cool for 5 to 10 minutes before icing. Alternatively,\
    \ allow the buns to cool to room temperature. Cover the buns and leave them at\
    \ room temperature overnight, then reheat in a 325\xB0F oven for 10 to 15 minutes\
    \ before icing and serving."
  - "To bake the buns after being refrigerated overnight: Remove the pan from the\
    \ refrigerator and leave the buns covered at room temperature while you preheat\
    \ the oven to 400\xB0F."
  - "Bake the buns for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden. A digital thermometer inserted\
    \ into the center of a middle bun should read 190\xB0F. Remove the buns from the\
    \ oven and cool for 5 to 10 minutes before icing."
  - Wrap the buns in plastic and store at room temperature for a day or so; freeze
    unfrosted buns for longer storage.

    and 4 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a
    firm dough. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 6-8 minutes.
    Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm
    place until doubled, about 1 hour.
  - Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Divide
    each portion into thirds. Shape each piece into a 15-in. rope.
  - Place three ropes on a greased baking sheet and braid; pinch ends to seal and
    tuck under. Repeat with remaining dough. Cover and let rise until doubled, about
    1 hour.
  - "Beat egg and cold water; brush over braids. Sprinkle with sesame or poppy seeds\
    \ if desired. Bake at 350\xB0 until golden brown, 30-40 minutes. Remove to wire\
    \ racks to cool."

  directions:
  - Cut the potatoes. Feel free to peel your potatoes or leave the skins on. Then
    cut them into evenly-sized chunks, about an inch or so thick, and transfer them
    to a large stockpot full of cold water.
  - Boil the potatoes. Once all of your potatoes are cut, be sure that there is enough
    cold water in the pan so that the water line sits about 1 inch above the potatoes.
    Stir the garlic and 1 tablespoon sea salt into the water. Then turn the heat to
    high and cook until the water comes to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-high (or
    whatever temperature is needed to maintain the boil) and continue cooking for
    about 10-12 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the middle of a potato goes
    in easily with almost no resistance. Carefully drain out all of the water.
  - Prepare your melted butter mixture. Meanwhile, as the potatoes are boiling, heat
    the butter, milk, garlic and an additional 2 teaspoons of sea salt together either
    in a small saucepan or in the microwave until the butter is just melted. (You
    want to avoid boiling the milk.) Set aside until ready to use.
  - Pan-dry the potatoes. After draining the water, immediately return the potatoes
    to the hot stockpot, place it back on the hot burner, and turn the heat down to
    low. Using two oven mitts, carefully hold the handles on the stockpot and shake
    it gently on the burner for about 1 minute to help cook off some of the remaining
    steam within the potatoes. Remove the stockpot entirely from the heat and set
    it on a flat, heatproof surface.
  - Mash the potatoes. Using your preferred kind of potato masher (I recommend this
    one in general, or this one for extra-smooth), mash the potatoes to your desired
    consistency.
  - Stir everything together. Then pour half of the melted butter mixture over the
    potatoes, and fold it in with a wooden spoon or spatula until potatoes have soaked
    up the liquid. Repeat with the remaining butter, and then again with the cream
    cheese, folding in each addition in until just combined to avoid over-mixing.
    (Feel free to add in more warm milk to reach your desired consistency, if needed.)
  - Taste and season. One final time, taste the potatoes and season with extra salt
    if needed.
  - Serve warm. Then serve warm, garnished with any extra toppings that you might
    like, and enjoy!

  directions:
  - In a small bowl, combine the sponge ingredients. Stir well to combine, loosely
    cover with plastic wrap, and set aside to proof for 10 to 15 minutes.
  - In the bowl of your stand mixer combine the sponge, yogurt, butter, eggs, sugar,
    salt, and flavoring. Add 4 1/2 cups of flour and mix with the paddle attachment
    until the dough is a rough, shaggy mass. Switch to the dough hook and knead on
    speed 2 until a soft, smooth dough forms, about 5 to 6 minutes, adding more flour
    if needed to achieve the correct consistency.
  - If you're using a bread machine, combine all the dough ingredients in the pan
    and set the machine on the dough cycle. Be sure to check the dough as it kneads
    and adjust the flour or water as needed to achieve a soft, supple consistency.
    Let the cycle complete itself.
  - If working by hand or stand mixer, place the kneaded dough in a lightly greased
    bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and allow to rise for 60 to 90 minutes, until quite
    puffy and nearly doubled.
  - While the dough is rising, prepare the filling. Combine all the filling ingredients
    (except the lemon curd) in a small bowl, mixing until smooth and lump-free. Reserve
    the filling and lemon curd until ready to fill the braids.
  - Gently deflate the dough and divide it in half. Cover half with plastic wrap and
    set it aside as you roll out the first piece into a 10" x 15" rectangle. Rolling
    on parchment paper makes moving the bread to the baking sheet much, much easier.
    Lightly press two lines down the dough lengthwise, to divide it into 3 equal sections.
    Spread half the cream cheese filling down the center section, and top with half
    the lemon curd, leaving 1" free on all sides of the filling.
  - 'To form the mock braid, cut 1" crosswise strips down the length of the outside
    sections, making sure you have the same number of strips down each side. Beginning
    on the left, lift the top dough strip and gently bring it across the filling diagonally.
    Repeat on the other side with the top dough strip, so that the two strips crisscross
    each other. Continue down the entire braid, alternating strips to form the loaf.
    For a helpful visual of this process, see our video: How to make a filled braid.'
  - Repeat the rolling, filling, and braiding steps for the second piece of dough,
    using the remaining cream cheese filling and lemon curd. Set both loaves aside,
    lightly covered, to rise for 45 to 50 minutes, or until quite puffy
  - "Preheat the oven to 375\xB0F. Brush the loaves with egg wash (one lightly beaten\
    \ egg, 2 teaspoons water and a pinch of salt), and sprinkle with coarse sparkling\
    \ sugar, if desired. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the loaves are golden\
    \ brown. Remove from the oven and cool for 15 to 20 minutes before serving."

  directions:
  - "Quarter, core, and peel the apples and slice them in \xBD-inch thick slices. "
  - 'In a small saucepan, simmer the onion with two tablespoons of the butter until
    transparent. '
  - Then stir in the sugar, cinnamon, and currants.
  - 'Arrange a layer of the apples in a casserole with a cover. '
  - 'Spoon a little of the onion mixture over them. Continue to alternate layers of
    apples and onions, finishing with a layer of apples. '
  - "Dot the remaining tablespoon of butter over the top, cover the casserole, and\
    \ bake at 375\xBA until the apples are soft- about forty-five minutes. Serve hot,\
    \ over buttered toast."
  - "\u2014"
  - '*Turkey*'
  - "Remove the giblets from the turkey, rinse the turkey under cold running water,\
    \ and dry it with a clean cloth. Put a large clean white cloth on the work surface\
    \ while boning the turkey \u2013 it will help to keep it from slipping around.\
    \ Place the turkey breast side down on the cloth and with a sharp boning knife,\
    \ cut through the skin down along the backbone from the neck to the tail. With\
    \ the knife at a slight angle and against the neck end of the bone, slowly but\
    \ firmly cut and push the meat away from the frame in the direction of the wings\
    \ and legs. When you reach the joints attached to the body of the bird, use scissors\
    \ to cut the tendons and loosen the joints so that they are free from the bony\
    \ frame of the body. Cut off the tips and the first sections of the wings."
  - Continue cutting downward along the ribs, first on one side of the breast, then
    the other, to the end of the breastbone. Cut slowly and carefully around the cartilage
    end of the breastbone so as not to tear the skin, and lift out the bony frame
    of the turkey.
  - Mix all the ingredients of the stuffing lightly but thoroughly. Flatten the boned
    turkey, skin side down, and put the stuffing in the center of the bird, piling
    it up lightly. Bring the two cut sides up over the dressing so that one side overlaps
    the other by about an inch. Bring the wings and legs close to the body and fold
    the cloth up over the stuffed turkey. Just before you put the bird into the pastry,
    remove the cloth. Mix together the salt, pepper, nutmeg, and cloves and spread
    them over the entire skin of the bird.
  - "For the pastry, sift the flour and salt together into a large bowl. Add \xBD\
    \ cup of the butter and crumble it into the flour until it is like cornmeal. Slice\
    \ the rest of the butter into \xBC inch cubes and stir them into the flour mixture.\
    \ Add enough cold chicken broth to the egg yolk to make \xBD cup of liquid, and\
    \ stir until well blended. Pour this liquid into the flour butter mix and stir\
    \ quickly until a ball of dough can be formed with the hands. If more liquid is\
    \ needed, add additional broth one tablespoon at a time."
  - "Sprinkle your work surface with flour and turn the ball of dough out onto the\
    \ flour. Flour your hands. Toss the ball lightly between your hands until it has\
    \ taken on enough flour to make it easy to handle. Divide the dough into two pieces:\
    \ \u2154 to make the lower crust, \u2153 for the top crust. Roll out the larger\
    \ piece and fit it into your baking dish (7\u201DX11\u201D rectangular dish suggested)\
    \ for the bottom crust. Roll out the pastry for the top crust, loosen it from\
    \ the work surface so it is ready to use."
  - Place the prepared turkey (without cloth) in the center of the pastry in the dish,
    breast side up, bringing the wings and legs close to the body. Cut 4 tablespoons
    of butter into thns slices and spread them over the top of the bird. Cover the
    turkey with the top crust and seal the edges with the tines of a fork dipped in
    water. Cut off any extra pastry (if desired, cut extra crust into turkeys and
    put on the top crust). Brush the pie with egg white.
  - "Bake at 450\xB0F for 20 minutes, then lower the heat to 325\xB0F and continue\
    \ baking for 1 \xBD hours. If it seems to be browning too quickly, cover it with\
    \ kitchen parchment. While the turkey is baking, make the sauce."
  - For the sauce, put all the ingredients except the egg yolks into a small saucepan
    and simmer for 15 minutes. Cover and set aside until needed. Just before serving
    the pie, beast two tablespoons of the sauce into the egg yolks, heat the remaining
    sauce to boiling, lower to a simmer, and stir in the beaten egg yolks, stirring
    constantly until the sauce begins to thicken. Remove pan from heat immediately
    and serve.
  - To serve, cut the top crust into serving-size portions. Carve the turkey and give
    each person a portion of crust with the meat. Pass the sauce separately or spoon
    a little directly over each serving.
  - "\u2014"
  - "Beat the butter with the milk (or rosewater if desired) until creamy, add the\
    \ sugar and beat it in. Mix in the seeds, the beaten eggs and the flour to form\
    \ a dough. Knead the dough on a lightly floured board and roll into \u201Csnakes\u201D\
    \ or long \u201Crolls\u201D approximated \xBC inch (5 mm) in diameter and 4 inches\
    \ (10 cm) long. Tie each roll into simple knots, rings, or braided strips and\
    \ arrange on lightly greased baking sheets or parchment paper. Bake in a moderate\
    \ oven (350\xB0 F) for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack,\
    \ then store in an airtight tin until needed. Makes about 15."

  directions:
  - Combine the 1 1/2 cups warm water, the sugar and kosher salt in the bowl of a
    stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast on top. Set aside for 5 minutes, or until the
    mixture foams.
  - Add the flour and butter and, using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed
    until well combined. Change to medium speed and knead until the dough is smooth
    and pulls away from the side of the bowl, 4 to 5 minutes.
  - Remove the dough from the bowl, clean the bowl, then oil it well. Return the dough
    to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place for 50 to
    55 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size.
  - Heat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line 2 half sheet pans with parchment paper and
    lightly brush with oil. Set aside.
  - Bring the 10 cups water and the baking soda to a rolling boil in a 12-inch straight-sided
    saute pan or a roasting pan (something wide and shallow is best).
  - Meanwhile, turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide into
    8 equal pieces. Roll out each piece of dough into a 24-inch rope. Make a U-shape
    with the rope, and, holding the ends of the rope, cross them over each other and
    press onto the bottom of the U in order to form the shape of a pretzel. Place
    on a half sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.
  - One by one, place the pretzels in the boiling water for 30 seconds. Remove them
    from the water using a large flat spatula. Return them to the sheet pans, brush
    the top of each pretzel with the beaten egg yolk and water mixture, and sprinkle
    with pretzel salt.
  - Bake until dark golden brown in color, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer to a cooling
    rack for at least 5 minutes before serving.

  directions:
  - Heat oil and butter in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium until butter
    is melted. Add onions and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until very tender
    and deeply golden brown, about 30 minutes. (Stop before the onions become dry
    and shriveled.) Add red pepper flakes (if using) and 1 1/2 tsp. salt. Remove pot
    from heat.
  - Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally,
    until al dente. Reserve 1 1/2 cups pasta cooking liquid.
  - Add pasta and 1 cup pasta cooking liquid to onion mixture and stir to combine.
    Add a small handful of cheese and stir until melted. Repeat with remaining cheese,
    adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed to create a glossy sauce that coats

  directions:
  - in a small bowl, mix the sugar, cinnamon and chopped peanuts together until combined.
  - Once the dough has had its first rise. Punch it down to let out the air. Then
    divide the dough in half. Put one half aside to be shaped later.
  - Roll one half of the dough out to a large rectangle about 16X8"
  - Spread the 3 tbsp of soft butter all over the dough, making sure to cover as much
    area as you can.
  - Sprinkle the Cinnamon sugar and peanut mixture all over the top of the buttered
    dough.
  - Then starting on one side of the long end of the dough, start to roll. Roll the
    dough into a log pulling backwards every once in a while to ensure a tight roll.
  - Place the log seam side down and mark off 2 inch segments. Cut the log into rolls.
    I used a bench scraper to do this, but I've heard that unflavored dental floss
    also does the trick! Place the rolls in the prepared cake pans face up.
  - Do the same with the second piece of dough.
  - Cover and allow to rise in a warm place for an hour, or until puffy and are touch
    on another.
  - Pre heat the oven to 350F
  - Brush the tops of the rolls with whole milk. Bake for 20-25 minutes.
  - While baking, make the glaze. Whisk the powdered sugar into the condensed milk.
    Add the milk 1 tablespoon at a time to loosen up the glaze to the desired consistency.
  - While the rolls are still warm, Pour or spread the glaze over the top. Serve warm!

  directions:
  - "Heat the oven to 350\xB0F and prep the pan. Arrange a rack in the bottom third\
    \ of the oven and heat to 350\xB0F. Line an 8x5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper,\
    \ letting the excess hang over the long sides to form a sling. Spray the inside\
    \ with cooking spray. \u2192 If using nuts, toast them in the oven for 10 minutes\
    \ as the oven is pre-heating."
  - "Melt the butter. Melt the butter in the microwave or over low heat on the stovetop.\
    \ \u2192 Alternatively, for a more cake-like banana bread, soften the butter (but\
    \ do not melt) and cream it with the sugar in a stand mixer in the next step."
  - Combine the butter and sugar. Place the melted butter and sugar in a large bowl
    and whisk until combined. (Or cream the softened butter and sugar in a mixer until
    fluffy.)
  - Add the eggs. Crack the eggs into the bowl. Whisk until completely combined and
    the mixture is smooth.
  - Add the milk and vanilla. Whisk the milk and vanilla into the batter.
  - Mash in the bananas. Peel the bananas and add them to the bowl. Using the end
    of the whisk or a dinner fork, mash them into the batter. Leave the bananas as
    chunky or as smooth as you prefer. If you prefer an entirely smooth banana bread,
    mash the bananas separately until no more lumps remain, and then whisk them into
    the batter.
  - Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Measure the flour, baking soda, and salt
    into the bowl. Switch to using a spatula and gently stir until the ingredients
    are just barely combined and no more dry flour is visible.
  - Fold in the nuts or chocolate, if using. Last but not least, scatter the nuts
    or chocolate over the batter and gently fold them in.
  - Pour the batter into the pan. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan, using
    the spatula to scrape all the batter from the bowl. Smooth the top of the batter.
  - "Bake for 50 to 65 minutes. Bake until the top of the cake is caramelized dark\
    \ brown with some yellow interior peeking through and a toothpick or cake tester\
    \ inserted into the middle comes out clean, 50 to 65 minutes. Baking time will\
    \ vary slightly depending on the moisture and sugar content of your bananas \u2014\
    \ start checking around 50 minutes and then every 5 minutes after."
  - "Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Set the loaf, still in the pan, on a wire cooling\
    \ rack. Let it cool for 10 minutes \u2014 this helps the loaf solidify and makes\
    \ it easier to remove from the pan."
  - Remove from pan and cool another 10 minutes. Grasping the parchment paper sling,
    lift the loaf out of the pan and place on the cooling rack. Cool for another 10
    minutes before slicing.

  directions:
  - "1. Preheat oven to 400\xB0F (200\xB0C) and line a baking sheet with parchment\
    \ paper; alternatively, grease the baking sheet with butter."
  - 2. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.
  - 3. Toss butter into dry ingredients until coated with flour. Working quickly,
    using your fingers or a pastry blender, rub or cut butter into flour until it
    resembles coarse meal. Alternatively, add flour mixture and butter to the bowl
    of a food processor and pulse 2 to 3 times to form pea-sized pieces; transfer
    to a large bowl.
  - 4. Add milk and stir with a fork until the mixture just comes together into a
    slightly sticky, shaggy dough.
  - 5. For small biscuits, use a teaspoon or a small cookie scoop to mound walnut-sized
    balls of dough onto prepared baking sheet. For large biscuits, use a 1/4-cup measuring
    cup to mound balls of dough onto prepared baking sheet.
  - 6. Bake biscuits until golden brown, about 15 minutes for small biscuits and 20
    minutes for large ones. Let cool slightly, then transfer to a wire rack. Serve
    warm or at room temperature.

    \ on the stove and keep whisking with a spatula, until you get a thick gel-consistency\
    \ mixture (and it reaches 65\xB0C which is 150\xB0F)"
  - Pour it onto a plate, cover with plastic wrap and let it cool at room temperature.
  - 'For the bread:'
  - "Into your stand mixer's bowl, combine flour, sugar, salt and activate. Then add\
    \ yeast and warm milk (ideally at 35-40\xB0 C / 95\xB0-104\xB0F)."
  - Gradually add the beaten egg, condensed milk (or powdered), Tangzhong and let
    everything incorporate.
  - Add the softened butter and let knead for about 20 minutes.
  - Place the dough into a bowl and cover with plastic wrap, let it rise for 50 minutes
    in a warm place.
  - After the dough has doubled in size, gently press it to degas it.
  - Divide it into 3 equal pieces and roll them into balls (like this). Cover and
    let them rise for 15 minutes.
  - "After 15 minutes, take the 3 balls and roll them like Umi does in this video\
    \ (it\u2019s easier for you to watch this rather than reading how to do it!) \u2013\
    \ click here."
  - Put the balls into a loaf pan (grease it if necessary. I used a paper pan like
    this so I didn't grease it) and let rise for 40 minutes.
  - Want to make buns? Instead of dividing in 4 balls, divide it into 8/10 balls,
    then let rise for 45 minutes.
  - "Preheat the oven at 180\xB0C (350\xB0F)."
  - Combine milk and egg, then brush the your bread and bake for about 20 minutes
    or until it gets puffy, and golden brown.
  - As soon as you take it out of the oven, brush it with more milk.
  - Let it cool down onto a cooling rack.
  - This bread surprisingly lasted a few days and it was so good after 5 days! Store
    it in an airtight container.

  directions:
  - To make the tangzhong
  - Whisk together the flour and water in a small saucepan until smooth. Place over
    a medium/low heat and whisk constantly until the mixture has thickened to a paste/pudding-like
    consistency (think wallpaper paste...). Scrape it into a small bowl, cover with
    clingfilm directly on the surface to prevent a skin from forming and leave to
    cool to room temperature.
  - To make the dough
  - Place the flour in a large bowl (or the bowl of your stand mixer, fitted with
    a dough hook) and add the yeast to one side, the salt, sugar and milk powder to
    the other (if the salt is added on top of the yeast it can kill it), stir to combine.
  - Whisk together the cooled tangzhong, egg and milk and add it to the dry ingredients.
    Mix everything together until it forms a soft, shaggy dough. If you are kneading
    by hand, turn the dough out onto a worktop and knead for 5-10 minutes until it
    starts to feel smooth and a little less sticky (it will still be very sticky),
    add no more than a spoonful of flour while you are kneading, the dough is meant
    to be sticky! The best way to knead a wet dough by hand is to stretch it up away
    from the worktop (it will stick), then slap it back down, make sure that you pull
    from a different section each time and keep a dough scraper handy. If you are
    using a stand mixer, mix for 5 minutes or so until the dough is smooth.
  - Add the butter and mix until it is fully incorporated, continue to knead until
    the dough is very elastic and begins to come away from the worktop (or sides of
    the stand mixer bowl) cleanly. It should pass the windowpane test - stretch the
    dough with your hands, you should be able to stretch it to a very thin, almost
    transparent membrane without it tearing. This can take up to 20 minutes of kneading,
    especially by hand.
  - Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with clingfilm, leave to rise
    for 1-2 hours until well doubled in size. Alternatively, place it in the fridge
    to rise overnight. If you refrigerate it, the following day let it come up to
    room temperature for about half an hour before continuing.
  - Line an 8.5x4.5in (or thereabouts) loaf tin with greaseproof paper. Once the dough
    has risen, punch it down and fold it in on itself a couple of times. Turn out
    onto a lightly floured surface, divide it in to four equal pieces and roll each
    one into a ball.
  - Roll each ball out into a long oval, fold one third of the oval over the middle
    (from the side, not the top), then the other third over the top to form a long,
    narrow packet. Roll over the seam to flatten it, then roll it up from one end
    to make a fat sausage. Repeat with the other balls of dough then arrange them
    in the loaf tin, seam side down.
  - Loosely cover with oiled clingfilm and leave to rise until at least doubled in
    size, this can take 1-2 hours (mine took nearly 2). If you press the dough gently
    with a finger the indentation should spring back slowly but remain visible. If
    it springs back quickly it needs to prove for a little longer. Preheat the oven
    while the dough is rising to 180C/350F/gas mark 4.
  - Brush the top of the dough with some of the beaten egg then bake on the lower
    middle shelf of the oven for 30-40 minutes until well risen and the bread sounds
    hollow when tapped on the bottom, the internal temperature should reach 94C/200F
    on a probe thermometer. Cover the bread with foil partway through baking if it
    starts to get too dark.
  - Transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool completely before slicing.

  directions:
  - 'FOR THE CRUST:'
  - Process 3/4 cup flour, salt, and sugar in food processor until combined, about
    two 1-second pulses. Add butter and shortening and process until homogenous dough
    just starts to collect in uneven clumps, about 10 seconds; dough will resemble
    cottage cheese curds with some very small pieces of butter remaining, but there
    should be no uncoated flour. Scrape bowl with rubber spatula and redistribute
    dough evenly around processor blade. Add remaining 1/2 cup flour and pulse until
    mixture is evenly distributed around bowl and mass of dough has been broken up,
    4 to 6 quick pulses. Empty mixture into medium bowl.
  - Sprinkle vodka and water over mixture. With rubber spatula, use folding motion
    to mix, pressing down on dough until dough is slightly tacky and sticks together.
    Flatten dough into 4-inch disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 45 minutes
    or up to 2 days.
  - Adjust oven rack to lowest position, place rimmed baking sheet on rack, and heat
    oven to 400 degrees. Remove dough from refrigerator and roll out on generously
    floured (up to 1/4 cup) work surface to 12-inch circle about 1/8 inch thick. Roll
    dough loosely around rolling pin and unroll into pie plate, leaving at least 1-inch
    overhang on each side. Working around circumference, ease dough into plate by
    gently lifting edge of dough with one hand while pressing into plate bottom with
    other hand. Refrigerate 15 minutes.
  - Trim overhang to 1/2 inch beyond lip of pie plate. Fold overhang under itself;
    folded edge should be flush with edge of pie plate. Using thumb and forefinger,
    flute edge of dough. Refrigerate dough-lined plate until firm, about 15 minutes.
  - Remove pie pan from refrigerator, line crust with foil, and fill with pie weights
    or pennies. Bake on rimmed baking sheet 15 minutes. Remove foil and weights, rotate
    plate, and bake 5 to 10 additional minutes until crust is golden brown and crisp.
    Remove pie plate and baking sheet from oven.
  - 'FOR THE FILLING:'
  - 'For the Filling: While pie shell is baking, whisk cream, milk, eggs, yolks, and
    vanilla together in medium bowl. Combine pumpkin puree, yams, sugar, maple syrup,
    ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in large heavy-bottomed saucepan; bring to
    sputtering simmer over medium heat, 5 to 7 minutes. Continue to simmer pumpkin
    mixture, stirring constantly and mashing yams against sides of pot, until thick
    and shiny, 10 to 15 minutes.'
  - Remove pan from heat and whisk in cream mixture until fully incorporated. Strain
    mixture through fine-mesh strainer set over medium bowl, using back of ladle or
    spatula to press solids through strainer. Rewhisk mixture and transfer to warm
    prebaked pie shell. Return pie plate with baking sheet to oven and bake pie for
    10 minutes. Reduce heat to 300 degrees and continue baking until edges of pie
    are set (instant-read thermometer inserted in center registers 175 degrees), 20
    to 35 minutes longer. (The center 2 inches of the pie should look firm but jiggle
    slightly.) Transfer pie to wire rack and cool to room temperature, 2 to 3 hours.
    Serve at room temperature with whipped cream.

  directions:
  - Check the rice and discard any debris. Place the rice in a fine-mesh sieve and
    rinse under running water until the water runs clear. Place the rice in a bowl,
    cover with water by 1 inch, and soak for 30 minutes.
  - 'As the rice soaks, cook the lamb: Place a medium saucepan with a heavy lid or
    a Dutch oven over medium heat. When the saucepan is hot, break the lamb into chunks,
    and cook until the fat renders, about 2 minutes. Drain most of the fat, leaving
    behind 1 to 2 tablespoons, and continue to cook the lamb until it browns, another
    2 minutes.'
  - "Add the ghee and heat over medium until it melts, 30 to 45 seconds. Add the garlic\
    \ and ginger and saut\xE9 for 1 minute."
  - "Add the garam masala, chile powder, black pepper and 1 teaspoon salt and saut\xE9\
    \ until the spices are fragrant, 1 minute. Add 1 tablespoon lime juice and stir\
    \ until the flavors come together, about 1 minute."
  - Transfer the lamb mixture to a large bowl and keep warm. (To do so, you could
    transfer it to a 250-degree oven.) Clean the saucepan and wipe dry.
  - Drain the soaked rice. Add to the same saucepan and cover with water by 1 inch.
    Stir in 1 tablespoon lime juice, the turmeric and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt.
    Bring to a boil over medium heat, then cover, and reduce heat to simmer until
    the rice absorbs all the water, about 10 minutes. (Do not stir the rice as it
    cooks, or the grains might break.) Remove the saucepan from heat, and let sit,
    uncovered, for 5 minutes.
  - Stir the rice into the cooked lamb mixture, then drizzle with the remaining 1
    tablespoon lime juice. Fold the scallions and mint into the rice, and serve immediately.

  directions:

  - Remove the quarters from the brine and break down into workable parts. I have
    left the meat bone-in.
  - braised-raccoon-prep
  - Quickly brown all sides in some olive oil. You do not want to cook through. That
    will be accomplished in the braising. I like browning on a cast iron skillet heated
    to smoking on a hot grill.
  - braised-raccoon-prep
  - After searing the raccoon will have nice brown bits that will add richness to
    the stew.

  - braised-raccoon-meat
  - "Cover and simmer until the raccoon is falling off the bone. 1\xBD -2 hours"
  - braised-raccoon-prep
  - "While the raccoon is braising to it\u2019s tender and moist perfection, go ahead\
    \ and prepare the ingredients for the sweet potato hash."
  - sweet-potatoes
  - When you are about 30 minutes from serving the braised raccoon, toss the diced
    sweet potatoes with olive oil, salt, pepper, some sprigs of thyme and pop in a
    400-degree oven. Roast until tender, but not mushy. Remove and set aside.
  - bacon-lardoons
  - "Saut\xE9 the bacon lardoons rendering some of the fat before adding diced onion\
    \ and apple. Cook until tender. Toss on the sliced green onion, and hit with a\
    \ drizzle of whiskey if you are so inclined. Add in the reserved roasted sweet\
    \ potatoes and sprinkle with pepitos."

  - This was easy to assemble and very tasty. I think I would use more apples if I
    make it again, as the cake to apple ratio was a bit too much. Very yummy served
    with vanilla ice cream-will try again with a few adjustments. VFE

  - "I thought this was delicious. I think I added about 6 cups of apples (5 medium\
    \ large apples). I also cut the sugar to 2/3 of a cup divided and used half whole\
    \ wheat flour and half regular flour. After reading the first review I made sure\
    \ to let it cook a little longer to make sure the pumpkin top was set (about 4.5\
    \ hours). I dumped off the excess water that collected inside the lid so it didn\u2019\
    t soak the cake part. If I made it again I would probably use more apples as they\
    \ cooked down quite a bit. I might also even try halving the pumpkin part as it\
    \ was a pretty thick layer."

  directions:
  - Dough
  - In the mixer bowl with a dough hook, combine milk, yeast, sugar, egg, egg yolks,
    sour cream, and vanilla. And use a whisk to combine well.
  - "Then, add the flour and salt \u2013 combine well with a spatula."
  - Start the mixer on and knead until everything forms a nice ball.
  - Then knead for 2 minutes more.
  - "After 2 minutes, start adding the room temperature butter \u2013 one cube at\
    \ a time."
  - Knead until all the butter is incorporated. Then knead 2 minutes more.
  - This should now be a beautifully soft, elastic and shiny dough (see video).
  - Place in an oiled bowl and cover with cling wrap.
  - Leave the dough to rise on the counter for an hour. Then place it in the fridge
    for another hour. (The cold dough is easier to work with)
  - Chocolate filling
  - Combine chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl.
  - Melt for a minute or more until all the chocolate is melted.
  - Leave at room temperature for the chocolate to cool.
  - It works best if the chocolate cools but is still in spreadable consistency.
  - Sugar syrup
  - Combine the sugar and water in a saucepan.
  - Heat on medium-low until all the sugar is melted.
  - Then, cool a minute more until syrup consistency.
  - Set aside until ready to use.
  - Laminate dough
  - Remove the dough from the fridge.
  - Lightly dust a work surface with flour and roll the dough to a rectangle approximately
    10 x 20 cm long.
  - Spread the chocolate over 2/3 of the rectangle.
  - Fold the rectangle like a book. Start with the third that has no chocolate and
    fold it over the center half then bring the other side over the first (see video).
  - Place it over a baking tray, cover with cling wrap and let chill for an hour.
  - Proof and bake
  - Cover the formed rugalach with a clean kitchen cloth and let proof for an hour.
  - Then, preheat the oven at 170C / 380 F.
  - For the egg wash, combine the egg and water.
  - Brush the rugelach with this egg wash.
  - Bake in the preheated oven for about 15 to 18 minutes on until golden.
  - When baked, immediately brush with sugar syrup.
  - Then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.
  - Enjoy!

  directions:
  - "Preheat the oven to 250\xB0F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and set\
    \ aside. Place 1 tablespoon each butter and vegetable oil in a heavy skillet,\
    \ and set it to heat over medium heat. Alternately, heat an electric griddle to\
    \ 300\xB0F."
  - In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, cream, salt, nutmeg, sugar, rum, and
    vanilla. Stir until smooth but not foamy. Pour the batter into a shallow casserole
    dish large enough to hold two pieces of bread snugly.
  - Place two pieces of bread in the pan; let them soak for about 30 seconds, then
    turn them over, and let soak for about 30 seconds on the other side. You want
    the bread to absorb some of the liquid, but not to become soggy.
  - Place the bread in the skillet or on the griddle, and fry until both sides are
    golden brown; this should take about 2 minutes each side.
  - Transfer the French toast to the baking sheet, and place it in the preheated oven.
    Allow it to remain in the oven while you cook the remaining pieces.
  - When all the pieces are cooked, serve the French toast with soft butter and maple
    syrup. Or dust it with confectioners' sugar or cinnamon-sugar.
  - Tips from our Bakers
  - Want to make a delicious holiday version of this recipe? Substitute eggnog for
    the 3/4 cup cream called for in the recipe.
  - Ordinarily you'd consider 2 to 3 pieces of French toast a single serving, but
    this particular recipe is so rich, and each slice of bread is big and thick enough,
    that we consider one piece a serving, particularly if you add fresh fruit and/or
    some breakfast ham, bacon or sausage.

  directions:
  - "In a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the flour, yeast, and salt.\
    \ Mix on low speed for 30 seconds to combine. In a separate bowl, combine the\
    \ lukewarm water, oil, honey, 2 of the eggs, and the egg yolk. Add to the dry\
    \ ingredients and knead on medium-low speed until you have a sticky dough that\
    \ clings to the bottom of the bowl, 5 to 7 minutes. The dough may seem too wet\
    \ but have faith\u2014it\u2019s supposed to be."
  - Dust your hands generously with flour, then scrape the sticky, elastic dough out
    onto a lightly floured work surface. Dust the top of the dough lightly with flour
    and knead briefly into a soft, smooth ball. Lightly grease a large bowl with oil
    or nonstick cooking spray. Place the dough in the bowl, flip it over once so the
    top is lightly oiled, and then cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Allow the dough
    to rise in a warm, draft-free spot until it's puffy and doubled in size, 2 to
    3 hours.
  - Invert the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and dust with flour. It will
    deflate. Cut the dough into four even 9-oz pieces, and then stretch and roll each
    piece into a rope about 20-inches long. Lay the ropes parallel to one another
    (vertically). Pinch them tightly together at the top, and then fan them out. If
    the ropes shrink a bit, just work them back into their original length.
  - 'Begin by taking the strand farthest to the right and weave it toward the left
    through the other strands using this pattern: over, under, over. Take the strand
    furthest to the right and repeat the weaving pattern again: over, under, over.
    Repeat this pattern, always starting with the strand farthest to the right, until
    the whole loaf is braided. Tuck the ends under to give the loaf a finished look.'
  - "Carefully transfer the braided loaf to a parchment-lined 13 x 18-inch baking\
    \ sheet. Cover the loaf loosely with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm, draft-free\
    \ spot until about 1.5 times the size, 1 to 2 hours. Toward the end of the rising\
    \ time, preheat the oven to 350\xB0F and set an oven rack in the middle position.\
    \ (Note that the loaf will continue to rise significantly in the oven.)"
  - "In a small bowl, beat the remaining egg and brush the beaten egg generously over\
    \ the risen dough. (Note: If you like, sprinkle poppy or sesame seeds onto the\
    \ challah before putting it in the oven.) Place the baking sheet atop another\
    \ baking sheet; this will prevent the bottom crust from browning too much. Bake\
    \ for 25 to 35 minutes, until the crust is a rich brown color and the internal\
    \ temperature is between 190\xB0F and 200\xB0F on an instant-read thermometer.\
    \ Remove the bread from the oven and place it on a rack to cool. Challah is best\
    \ enjoyed fresh, but leftovers will keep for a few days in a sealed plastic bag."
  - 'Note: When baking yeast breads, rising times are only a guide; the temperature
    in your kitchen, the humidity level outdoors, and how you knead the dough will
    all affect the rising time.'
  - 'Make-Ahead Instructions: Prepare the loaf up to the point where it''s braided
    and on the pan. Cover it with greased plastic wrap, and place it in the refrigerator
    overnight. The next day, remove the braided dough from the refrigerator and set
    it on the countertop (keep it covered). Let it come to room temperature and rise
    for about 1 hour before baking as directed.'
  - 'Freezer-Friendly Instructions: Challah can be baked, cooled, tightly wrapped,
    and frozen for up to 3 months. Allow it to thaw at room temperature for at least
    3 hours before serving.'

  directions:
  - "Preheat your oven to 425\xB0F with a rack in the upper portion. Get out a baking\
    \ sheet; there's no need to grease it. Line it with parchment if you like, for\
    \ easiest cleanup."
  - Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping
    off any excess.
  - Mix together the flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar.
  - Work the butter into the flour mixture using your fingers, a fork or pastry blender,
    a stand mixer, or a food processor; your goal is an evenly crumbly mixture (think
    breadcrumbs).
  - "Drizzle the smaller amount of milk evenly over the flour mixture. Mix quickly\
    \ and gently for about 15 seconds, until you've made a cohesive dough. If the\
    \ mixture seems dry and won't come together, don't keep working it; drizzle in\
    \ enough milk \u2014 up to an additional 2 tablespoons (28g) to make it cohesive."
  - Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface. Pat it into a rough rectangle
    about 3/4" thick. Fold it into thirds like a letter and roll gently with a floured
    rolling pin until the dough is 3/4" thick again.
  - Cut the dough into circles with a biscuit cutter for traditional round biscuits;
    a 2 3/8" cutter makes nice-sized biscuits. Or to avoid leftover dough scraps,
    cut the dough into squares or diamonds with a bench knife or sharp knife.
  - Place the biscuits bottom side up on your prepared baking sheet; turning them
    over like this yields biscuits with nice, smooth tops. Brush the biscuits with
    milk, to enhance browning.
  - Bake the biscuits for 15 to 20 minutes, until they're lightly browned. Remove
    them from the oven, and serve warm.
  - Store any leftover biscuits, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days.
    Freeze for longer storage. Biscuits are always best when they're rewarmed before
    serving.
  - Tips from our Bakers
  - Using room-temperature butter and working it into the flour until the mixture
    is an even, breadcrumb-like consistency will yield tender biscuits with an even,
    light crumb. Using cold butter and working it into the flour until the mixture
    is unevenly crumbly, on the other hand, will result in higher-rising biscuits
    that are "layered" and flaky.
  - Substitute buttermilk, light cream, or heavy cream for the whole milk, if you
    prefer. Use enough of whatever liquid you choose to bring the dough together readily,
    without having to work it too much. For more tips on how to substitute different
    liquids and fats in biscuits, see our blog post, Fats and liquids in biscuits.
  - Placing cut biscuits closer together (with 1/4" of space between them) will help
    them rise higher and straighter; they'll literally hold each other up as they
    rise in the oven. The sides will be softer, also. If you like a crisp biscuit,
    space them at least 1" apart on the baking sheet so the oven's heat can reach
    their sides.
  - If you're going to use the biscuits for shortcakes, increase the sugar to 2 tablespoons,
    and stir 1 teaspoon vanilla into the dry mixture along with the milk. Also, dissolve
    a teaspoon of sugar in the tablespoon or so of milk you use to brush the tops;
    this will help them brown nicely and impart mild sweetness to the crust.
  - "If you have time, prepare the biscuits up to the point they're on the pan before\
    \ preheating your oven. Place the pan of biscuits in the refrigerator while you\
    \ preheat your oven to 425\xB0F, or for about 20 to 30 minutes. This short chill\
    \ will help them maintain their shape while baking."

  description: This is my attempt to reduce to a recipe my mom's cornbread dressing.
    She never worked from a recipe; it was more of a method. It was always delicious!
    One year she sent leftovers home with the black lady who used to keep house for
    us. She reported back that after her husband tasted it, he said, "I never knew
    any white woman could make dressing that tastes this good!"
  difficulty: ''
  directions:
  - 1. Crumble cornbread into a large bowl, and add seasonings.
  - "2. Saut\xE9 the trinity (onion, celery, and bell pepper) in butter until soft\
    \ but not brown. "
  - "3. Add saut\xE9d trinity and drippings from roasted turkey to the cornbread mixture\
    \ and combine. The mixture should be wet enough to clump together and keep its\
    \ shape, but not so wet that it's mushy. If the mixture is not wet enough after\

  directions:
  - 'To make the dough: Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into
    a cup, then sweeping off any excess.'
  - Combine all of the dough ingredients and mix and knead them, by hand, mixer, or
    bread machine, until you have a soft, smooth dough.
  - Allow the dough to rise in a plastic wrap-covered bowl for about 2 hours, or until
    it's puffy; it won't necessarily double in bulk.
  - Gently deflate the dough, and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface.
  - 'Next step: divide the dough into pieces, the number depending on what kind of
    braid you want to make. You may braid the challah the traditional way, into a
    three-strand braid; for helpful tips watch our video, How to braid a three-strand
    loaf. For a fancier presentation, make a six-strand braid; watch our video, How
    to braid a six-strand loaf, to see how it''s done. To make a four-strand braid
    see "tips," below.'
  - Once you've decided which braid you're doing, divide the dough into the appropriate
    number of pieces. Roll each piece into a rope about 20" long. If the dough starts
    to shrink back as you roll, cover it and let it rest for about 10 minutes, then
    resume rolling. The short rest gives the gluten a chance to relax.
  - Braid the loaf. Remember, for three- or six-strand braids, watch the videos linked
    above. For a four-strand braid, see "tips," below.
  - Gently pick up the braided loaf, and place it on a lightly greased or parchment-lined
    baking sheet.
  - "Cover the loaf with lightly greased plastic wrap, and let it rise until it's\
    \ very puffy, 90 minutes to 2 hours at cool room temperature. Towards the end\
    \ of the rising time, preheat the oven to 375\xB0F."
  - 'To make the glaze: Whisk together the egg and water. Brush the glaze over the
    risen loaf.'
  - Place the baking sheet atop another baking sheet; this will insulate the bread's
    bottom crust, and keep it from browning too much. Put the challah in the lower
    third of the oven, and bake it for 20 minutes. If it's a deep golden brown, tent
    it loosely with aluminum foil. If it's not as brown as you like, check it again
    at 30 minutes.
  - "Once you've tented the challah, bake it for an additional 10 to 15 minutes, until\
    \ the loaf looks and feels set and its interior registers at least 190\xB0F."
  - Remove the bread from the oven, and place it on a rack to cool.
  - Store any leftover bread, well wrapped in plastic, at room temperature for several
    days; freeze for longer storage. While challah does tend to dry out after a day
    or so, it's always good toasted, or made into grilled sandwiches or French toast.
  - Tips from our Bakers
  - Join King Arthur baker Martin Philip and his family as they bake Classic Challah
    together, start to finish. Watch Martin Bakes at Home - Challah now.
  - During Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, this bread's traditional braided shape
    is supplanted by a spiral, which symbolizes the cyclical nature of the year. For
    a spiralled challah, roll the dough into a 36" rope, and coil it into a lightly
    greased 9" cake pan. Allow it to rise until puffy, then bake as directed in the
    original recipe.
  - For poppy seed or sesame seed challah, sprinkle the loaf heavily with seeds after
    applying the glaze.
  - 'Hesitant about making a six-strand braid? Try this four-strand braid:'
  - Divide the dough into four pieces, and shape each piece into a rough 6" log. Cover
    the logs with lightly greased plastic wrap, and let rest for 10 minutes.
  - Roll each log into a 15" rope. Cover, and let rest for 10 minutes.
  - Continue rolling the ropes until they're about 20" long; they'll shrink back to
    about 18" as they sit.
  - Lay the strands parallel to one another, and pinch the ends on your left together.
  - Take the rope nearest you, and move it up over the next two adjoining ropes.
  - Next, move the rope back under the rope next to it. Fan the ends of the ropes
    out again.
  - Repeat the process, but start with the rope farthest away from you. Bring it down
    and across the next two adjoining ropes, and then back under the rope nearest
    it.
  - Continue in this fashion, alternating which side you begin with until you've braided
    the whole loaf.
  - Pinch the loose ends together, and tuck them underneath the loaf.
  - 'Make it whole wheat: While challah made with 100% whole wheat flour will be heavier
    than that made with all-purpose flour, it will still be soft and delicious. For
    best flavor, we recommend substituting white whole wheat flour for the all-purpose
    flour. Increase the amount of water to 3/4 cup, adding up to an additional 2 tablespoons
    water if necessary to make a soft, smooth dough. Allow the just-mixed dough to
    rest for 20 minutes before kneading; this gives the flour a chance to absorb the
    liquid, making it easier to knead.'
  - 'Make it sugar-free: Substitute 6 tablespoons water for the honey called for in
    the recipe; be aware the dough will rise more quickly. The finished bread will
    taste quite bland, not at all like classic challah; its crust will be hard and
    blistered, and it won''t brown as nicely. Using at least 2 tablespoons honey (instead
    of eliminating it entirely) will help the bread taste and look more like classic
    challah.'
  - 'Make it ahead: Prepare the loaf up to the point where it''s braided and on the
    pan. Tent it with greased plastic wrap, and place it in the refrigerator overnight.
    Next morning, remove the dough from the refrigerator (keep it covered). Let it
    warm and rise at room temperature for 60 minutes before baking as directed.'

  directions:
  - Instant Pot instructions
  - Place all ingredients into an Instant Pot in the order listed, EXCEPT for the
    butter, cream and 1 teaspoon of the garam masala, mixing the sauce well before
    you place the chicken on top of the sauce. If it's frozen, push it into the sauce
    a bit so it defrosts better
  - Close the cooker and set for 10 mins on high, and let it release pressure naturally
    for 10 minutes. After that, release all remaining pressure.
  - Open up the pot and remove the chicken carefully and set aside
  - Blend together all the ingredients, preferably using an immersion blender
  - Add the cut up butter, cream, cilantro, and garam masala and stir until well incorporated.
  - It's best to let the sauce cool just a little before adding the butter and the
    cream. Adding it into the boiling sauce will make your sauce very thin. If that
    happens, just put it in the fridge for a little and let it thicken up. It should
    be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon
  - Take out half the sauce and freeze for later or store in the fridge for 2-3 days
  - Add the chicken back in and heat through. Break it up into smaller pieces if you
    need but don't shred it.
  - Serve over rice, or zucchini noodles
  - Using leftover sauce
  - Use leftover cooked chicken and mix in with the gently heated sauce, let it simmer
    for a few for the flavors to meld together and there you go. Add some fresh cilantro
    on top.
  - You could also use this for Paneer Makhani. Defrost a cup of peas and 1 cup of
    paneer and mix gently into the heated sauce and let it simmer for a few for the
    flavors to meld together and there you go.
  - Watch The Video
  - If you use a stand blender, be very careful with the hot sauce and be sure to
    leave the inside lid open to vent.
  - Yes, I know the recipe doesn't call for additional liquid. The chicken and tomatoes
    release a LOT of liquid. Unless you do something wrong, it will not burn.
  - Do not re-pressure cook the butter and cream filled sauce for a second time as
    it gets thin and unappetizing. Cook the chicken when you first make the sauce,
    save half the tomato sauce frozen, and when you're ready, add cooked chicken,
    or paneer, and heat it through in a skillet. Instant dinner!
  - For this recipe, the garam masala is very, very, important. Unlike other recipes,
    I didn't use whole spices because I've learned that not everyone has whole cinnamon
    sticks, whole cloves, and green cardamom lying around. So we'll use garam masala
    instead and I must urge you to make this homemade garam masala recipe! It makes
    a HUGE difference.
  - You'll note there's no added water in this recipe. Between the tomatoes and the
    chicken, there's more than enough to create pressure in this recipe. Any more
    water and it's going to taste insipid.
  - Let the sauce cool just a little before adding the butter and the cream. Adding
    it to the boiling sauce will make your sauce very thin. If that happens, just
    put it in the fridge for a little and let it thicken up. It should be thick enough
    to coat the back of a spoon.

  directions:
  - Start by combining flour, sugar and salt together. Mix with a spatula. Add boiling
    water and slowly incorporate
  - now microwave some cold milk for 30 seconds. add yeast and mix. pour into the
    flour and water mixture. add eggs and mix. the dough should be very sticky. DO
    NOT add more flour. Rest for 20 mins with a lid on
  - after you have rested add oil. Oil should make the dough no sticky. Knead the
    dough until the oil in incorporated and it is sticky again. Cover and rest for
    1 hour.
  - after one hour, punch the dough with floured hands until you have let most of
    the air out. It should be about the size of the dough before resting. Now, split
    into three pieces. flour a surface and roll it out. fold both ways in. then, smooth
    side down, roll it out with a pin. With your hands, roll it into a roll ( sorry,
    is this confusing?) and place into a prepared bread tin. This is optional. If
    you want to just place all the pieces into the bread tin. but doing that will
    help the bread have more layers and fluffiness. rest in bread tin for 1 hour.
  - now, make your egg wash by combing all ingredients and mix with a whisk. using
    a brush, brush a thin layer on. cook at 190C for 30 mins. take out and cool for
    5 mins. You can split them open with your hands or cut with a knife. Enjoy!!!

  directions:
  - "Before you begin: note that the pastry recipe will make 12 cream puffs OR 20\
    \ to 24 \xE9clairs. The filling recipes (whipped cream, and pastry cream) make\
    \ enough for 12 pastries each. The icing recipe is a generous amount for icing\
    \ 2 dozen \xE9clairs. If you simply want to drizzle the \xE9clairs with icing,\
    \ cut both the chocolate and cream in half."
  - "Preheat the oven to 425\xB0F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking\
    \ sheets."
  - Combine the water, butter, and salt in a medium-sized saucepan, heat until the
    butter has melted, and bring to a rolling boil.
  - Remove the pan from the heat, and add the flour all at once, stirring vigorously.
  - Return the pan to the burner and cook over medium heat, stirring all the while,
    until the mixture smooths out and follows the spoon around the pan; this should
    take less than a minute.
  - "Remove the pan from the heat, and let the mixture cool for 5 to 10 minutes. It'll\
    \ still feel hot, but you should be able to hold a finger in it for a few seconds.\
    \ If you have an instant-read thermometer, the temperature should be below 125\xB0\
    F."
  - Transfer the mixture to a mixer, and beat in the eggs one at a time; it'll look
    curdled at first, but when you add the last egg it should become smooth. Beat
    for at least 2 minutes after adding the last egg.
  - "Using a generously filled tablespoon cookie scoop, or a level muffin scoop, drop\
    \ the thick batter onto the prepared baking sheets in 3- to 4-tablespoon mounds.\
    \ Space the mounds about 3\" apart, to allow for expansion. For \xE9clairs, pipe\
    \ the batter into 5\" logs about 1/2\" to 3/4\" in diameter."
  - "Bake the pastries for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350\xB0\
    F and bake for an additional 25 minutes, until pastries are a medium golden brown.\
    \ Don't open the oven door while the pastries are baking."
  - Remove the pastries from the oven. Make a small slit in the top of each, and return
    them to the oven for 5 minutes, to allow the steam to escape. Place them on a
    rack to cool. When they're cool enough to handle, split each in half to make top
    and bottom pieces; splitting and exposing the centers to air will help keep them
    from becoming soggy.
  - 'To make the cream puff filling: Pour the cream into a mixing bowl, and begin
    to whip it on high speed (using your mixer''s whisk attachment, if you have one).
    Sprinkle in the sugar gradually as the cream whips. Whip until stiff, but be careful
    not to over-whip; cream should still look smooth.'
  - Fill the bottom halves of the puffs with whipped cream, then replace their tops.
    Dust with confectioners' sugar, and serve.
  - "To make the \xE9clair filling: Prepare your favorite pastry cream filling; see\
    \ tips below for our favorite. You'll need about 3 cups of filling."
  - "Spoon the filling into the \xE9clair shells."
  - 'To make the icing: Place the chocolate chips or chunks and cream in a microwave-safe
    bowl or measuring cup.'
  - Heat over low heat (or in the microwave) until the cream is very hot.
  - "Remove from the heat, and stir until the chocolate melts and the icing is smooth.\
    \ Spoon over the \xE9clairs, spreading to the edges. Serve immediately."
  - Want to make profiteroles? Fill cream puff shells with ice cream, and drizzle
    with the sauce of your choice; chocolate is traditional.
  - "To shape \xE9clairs without a pastry bag, place a sandwich bag into a glass,\
    \ rolling its edge over the rim to hold it in place. Spoon the batter into the\
    \ bag. Cut off 1 corner of the bag, making a 1/2\" cut. Squeeze the batter onto\
    \ the baking sheet through the hole in the corner."
  - Want to prepare pastries ahead? Make the shells and store them at room temperature,
    lightly covered. Your best bet is to whip the cream no more than several hours
    ahead of time. Pastry cream filling/pudding can be made several days ahead. Icing
    can be made several days ahead and reheated. Fill (and ice) pastries just before
    serving.
  - Our pastry cream filling mix is a real time-saver; you'll need about 3 cups. Or,
    pour 3 cups (681g) milk into a bowl (the higher-fat the milk, the richer the filling);
    add the contents of 2 regular-size boxes of vanilla instant pudding mix, plus
    2 teaspoons vanilla extract. Beat until thick, and refrigerate until ready to
    use.
  - 'For a special taste treat, infuse your pastry''s cream filling with tea flavor.
    See how it''s done: Baking with tea: little leaves, big flavor.'

  directions:
  - 'To make the tangzhong: Combine all of the ingredients in a small saucepan, and
    whisk until no lumps remain.'
  - Place the saucepan over low heat, and cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until
    thick and the whisk leaves lines on the bottom of the pan, about 3 to 5 minutes.
  - Transfer the tangzhong to a small mixing bowl or measuring cup and let it cool
    to room temperature.
  - "To make the dough: Combine the tangzhong with the remaining dough ingredients,\
    \ then mix and knead \u2014 by hand, mixer, or bread machine \u2014 until a smooth,\

  - Shape the dough into a ball, and let it rest in a lightly greased covered bowl
    for 60 to 90 minutes, until puffy but not necessarily doubled in bulk.
  - Gently deflate the dough, divide it into 8 equal pieces, and shape each piece
    into a ball.
  - Place the rolls into a lightly greased 8" or 9" round cake pan. Cover the pan,
    and let the rolls rest for 40 to 50 minutes, until puffy.
  - "Preheat the oven to 350\xB0F. Brush the rolls with milk or egg wash (1 large\
    \ egg beaten with 1 tablespoon cold water), and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until\
    \ golden brown on top; a digital thermometer inserted into the center of the middle\
    \ roll should read at least 190\xB0F."
  - Remove the rolls from the oven. Allow them to cool in the pan for 10 minutes,
    then transfer them to a rack to cool completely.
  - Tips from our Bakers
  - "To make a loaf: After the dough's initial rise, divide it into four equal pieces.\
    \ Flatten each piece into a rectangle, then fold the short ends in towards one\
    \ another like a letter. Flatten the folded pieces into rectangles again and,\
    \ starting with a short end, roll them each into a log. Place the logs in a row\
    \ of four \u2014 seam side down and side by side \u2014 in a lightly greased 9\"\
    \ x 5\" loaf pan. Cover the loaf and allow it to rest/rise for 40 to 50 minutes,\
    \ until puffy. Brush the loaf with milk or egg wash and bake at 350\xB0F for about\
    \ 30 minutes, until golden brown on top and a digital thermometer inserted into\
    \ the center of the loaf reads at least 190\xB0F. Remove the loaf from the oven,\
    \ and cool it on a rack."

  directions:
  - "Preheat the oven to 375\xB0F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking\
    \ sheets."
  - In a large bowl, combine the sugars, butter, shortening, salt, vanilla and almond
    extracts, vinegar, and baking soda, beating until smooth and creamy.
  - Beat in the egg, again beating until smooth. Scrape the bottom and sides of the
    bowl with a spatula to make sure everything is thoroughly combined.
  - Mix in the flour, then the chips.
  - Use a spoon (or a tablespoon cookie scoop) to scoop 1 1/4" balls of dough onto
    the prepared baking sheets, leaving 2" between them on all sides; they'll spread.
  - Bake the cookies for 11 to 12 minutes, until their edges are chestnut brown and
    their tops are light golden brown, almost blonde.
  - Remove the cookies from the oven, and cool on the pan until they've set enough
    to move without breaking. Repeat with the remaining dough.
  - Tips from our Bakers
  - Want to make this gluten-free? For great results, substitute King Arthur Gluten-Free
    Measure for Measure Flour for the all-purpose flour in this recipe. Be sure to
    bake thoroughly; gluten-free baked goods often need a bit more time in the oven.
  - To make mocha chocolate chip cookies, add 1/2 teaspoon espresso powder to the
    dough along with the salt.
  - To bake extra-big, bake sale-style (5") cookies, scoop the dough in scant 1/3-cupfuls
    onto the baking sheets. Bake for 13 to 14 minutes (if the dough hasn't been refrigerated),
    or 17 to 18 minutes (if it's been refrigerated).
  - A mere sprinkling of sea salt atop the balls of cookie dough before baking adds
    wonderful flavor to the finished cookies.
  - For a deeper flavor, more toffee/caramel than vanilla, refrigerate the dough for
    24 to 48 hours before scooping and baking. Bake till cookies are brown around
    the edges, with just a bit of pale center, about 12 minutes.
  - Looking to cut back on the sugar in your baking? See our blog post, How to reduce
    sugar in cookies and bars.
  - Skip the scooping and cut down on prep time by using an ingenious technique outlined
    in our blog post, A simple way to shape cookies.

  directions:
  - Place flour, sugar, yeast, and salt into the bowl of the stand mixer. Mix.
  - Add oil, eggs, water, and vanilla extract. Knead using a bread hook. Leave the
    dough to mix on low for 10 minutes, at the end of which it should be smooth but
    tacky. Add more flour if needed.
  - Move the dough to an oiled bowl. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let sit
    until double in size.
  - Place the dough on a well floured surface and sprinkle the top with flour as well.
    Roll the dough out until it is about 1/2 inch or 1.5 cm. Cutout circles using
    a 2'' or 3" cookie cutter dipped in flour.
  - Using a spatula, carefully remove the circles and place them on a floured tray.
    Take the remaining scraps and knead them together. Let sit for 5 minutes.
  - Repeat steps 4 and 5 until dough is used up. Sprinkle the circles with flour and
    cover with a towel. Set aside and let sit for 40 minutes in a warm place.
  - "Heat the oil to 320\xB0F to 340\xB0F or 160\xB0C to 170\xB0C. If you do not have\
    \ a thermometer, test the oil by placing a small piece of dough in it. If it sizzles\
    \ and floats, the oil is hot enough."
  - "Place 3 or 4 sufganiyot in the pot one at a time. Do not crowd. Let them simmer\
    \ for 1 \xBD minutes on each side until golden brown. Remove and set aside."
  - Using a squeeze bottle or a syringe filled with jelly, puncture a hole in the

    using your fingers or a pastry blender, rub or cut butter into flour until it
    resembles coarse meal. Alternatively, add flour mixture and butter to the bowl
    of a food processor and pulse 2 to 3 times to form pea-sized pieces; transfer
    to a large bowl.
  - 4. Add milk and stir with a fork until the mixture just comes together into a
    slightly sticky, shaggy dough.
  - 5. For small biscuits, use a teaspoon or a small cookie scoop to mound walnut-sized
    balls of dough onto prepared baking sheet. For large biscuits, use a 1/4-cup measuring
    cup to mound balls of dough onto prepared baking sheet.
  - 6. Bake biscuits until golden brown, about 15 minutes for small biscuits and 19
    minutes for large ones. Let cool slightly, then transfer to a wire rack. Serve
    warm or at room temperature.

  directions:
  - The Tangzhong
  - In a non-stick pan, cook 35g of flour and 175g of water. Stir until it becomes
    a homogeneous paste. It needs to be at room temperature when used, so let it cool
    down completely. If possible, prepare this one day in advance and keep it overnight
    on the fridge.
  - 'The Bread:'
  - "If you\u2019ve prepared your Tangzhong the day before, remove it from the fridge\
    \ and let it warm up until room temperature."
  - "Just before you start to prepare your dry ingredients, warm up 140g of milk.\
    \ Don\u2019t overdo it as it only needs to be lukewarm when used."
  - "In a bowl, add your dry ingredients \u2014 340g of flour, 3g of salt, 30g of\
    \ sugar and, 5g of dry yeast. Mix and add your main wet ingredients \u2014 1 medium\
    \ or large egg and 140g of lukewarm milk. Mix to combine and add your Tangzhong\
    \ mixture. Make sure that it is at room temperature. Finally, add 40g of unsalted\
    \ butter and mix again."
  - Using a stand mixer at low speed, knead the dough for roughly 10 minutes or until
    the dough is smooth and elastic. Kneading by hand is possible and should take
    15 to 20 minutes to get the same results.
  - Transfer the dough to a pre-oiled bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Let it
    rest in a warm place for 45 minutes. You should see a significant expansion.
  - Add flour to your kitchen bench and rolling pin. Transfer the dough to the surface
    and divide it into three equal size balls. The dough should be somewhat sticky,
    so make use of some water on your hand if you are struggling to manipulate the
    dough. Working one ball at a time, use your rolling pin to stretch it in a rectangle.
    Fold the bottom third over the middle and the top third over the now thicker middle.
    Turn it 90 degrees and use your rolling pin to stretch it again. Starting at the
    bottom, roll it until you get an even cylinder. Do the same with the remaining
    two balls.
  - Grease a loaf pan and put your three rolls side by side and cover it with plastic
    wrap. Let it rest for 20 minutes.
  - Preheat your oven to 175c and prepare a mixture of one egg and milk. After the
    dough significantly rises again, brush the top with your egg and milk mixture.
  - Bake it for 25 minutes at 175c. You should see the dough rise and top to get evenly
    brown. One of the sides might slightly break but should not be too significant.
  - Let it cool down 15 minutes and remove it from the loaf pan. Give it 20 to 30
    minutes or until it feels significantly cooler before cutting a slice.

  directions:
  - '1 Rinse and soak rice: Place rice in a sieve and run cool water through it to
    rinse it until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in cool water for 30 minutes.
    Drain.'
  - '2 Boil rice with cloves, cardamom, cinnamon: Bring 8 cups of water and the salt
    to a boil in a large pot. Add the rice and stir. Add the cloves, cardamom and
    cinnamon and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes.'
  - Note that not all of the water will be absorbed!
  - After 8 minutes, taste the rice, and test if it is done to your taste; rice can
    take more or less time to cook depending on how old it is. If still too firm,
    cook a few minutes longer.
  - '3 Drain rice and rinse with cold water, remove spices: When the rice is cooked
    to your liking, drain the rice into a colander and rinse with cold water to stop
    if from cooking.'
  - Remove the cloves, cardamom and cinnamon and discard. Set the rice aside to drain.
  - "4 Saut\xE9 mustard seeds, cumin, chili flakes, then onion: In a pan large enough\
    \ to hold the rice, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the mustard and cumin seeds\

  - Cook until the mustard seeds start popping, then add the chopped onion. Cook until
    the onions begin to brown, about 5-7 minutes.
  - '5 Add garlic, then rice and turmeric: Add the garlic and cook another 2-3 minutes.
    Add the rice and mix well. Sprinkle the turmeric over the rice and mix well. Cook
    for another 3-4 minutes, stirring often.'

  directions:
  - Combine the water, butter, and salt in a medium-sized saucepan, heat until the
    butter has melted, and bring to a rolling boil.
  - Remove the pan from the heat, and add the flour all at once, stirring vigorously.
  - Return the pan to the burner and cook over medium heat, stirring all the while,
    until the mixture smooths out and follows the spoon around the pan; this should
    take considerably less than a minute.
  - "Remove the pan from the heat, and let the mixture cool for 5 to 10 minutes. It'll\
    \ still feel hot, but you should be able to hold a finger in it for a few seconds.\
    \ If you have an instant-read thermometer, the temperature should be below 125\xB0\
    F."
  - Transfer the mixture to a mixer, and beat in the eggs one at a time. The batter
    will look curdled at first, but when you add the last egg it should become smooth.
    Beat for at least 2 minutes after adding the last egg.
  - "Pour a generous 4 cups vegetable oil (peanut oil preferred) into a 10\" electric\
    \ frying pan or heavy skillet set over a burner; the oil should be about 5/8\"\
    \ deep. If you use a smaller or larger pan, add oil to a depth of between 1/2\"\
    \ and 3/4\". Heat the oil to 375\xB0F."
  - Scoop small (1") balls of batter into the hot oil, filling the pan but not crowding
    the doughnuts. A teaspoon cookie scoop, filled level, works well here.
  - Fry the doughnuts for about 6 minutes. As they cook they'll turn themselves over,
    usually multiple times. Use a chopstick or pair of tongs to give a nudge to any
    that seem to be stuck on one side. After about 6 minutes, the doughnuts should
    be a deep golden brown.
  - Transfer them from the frying pan to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain
    and cool. Repeat with the remainder of the batter.
  - Use a pastry bag equipped with a plain tip to pipe jelly into the interior of
    the cooled doughnuts. Shake them gently in a bag with granulated or confectioners'
    sugar. Serve immediately; or wrap loosely and store at room temperature. The doughnuts
    will gradually soften as they sit.

    \ hours). I dumped off the excess water that collected inside the lid so it didn\u2019\
    t soak the cake part. If I made it again I would probably use more apples as they\
    \ cooked down quite a bit. I might also even try halving the pumpkin part as it\
    \ was a pretty thick layer."

  - Apple mixture on the bottom was tasty. However, pumpkin cake portion was a big
    disappointment. I will not be making this again.

  directions:
  - "Heat the oven to 350\xB0F and prep the pan. Arrange a rack in the bottom third\
    \ of the oven and heat to 350\xB0F. Line an 8x5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper,\
    \ letting the excess hang over the long sides to form a sling. Spray the inside\
    \ with cooking spray. \u2192 If using nuts, toast them in the oven for 10 minutes\
    \ as the oven is pre-heating."
  - "Melt the butter. Melt the butter in the microwave or over low heat on the stovetop.\
    \ \u2192 Alternatively, for a more cake-like banana bread, soften the butter (but\
    \ do not melt) and cream it with the sugar in a stand mixer in the next step."
  - Combine the butter and sugar. Place the melted butter and sugar in a large bowl
    and whisk until combined. (Or cream the softened butter and sugar in a mixer until
    fluffy.)
  - Add the eggs. Crack the eggs into the bowl. Whisk until completely combined and
    the mixture is smooth.
  - Add the milk and vanilla. Whisk the milk and vanilla into the batter.
  - Mash in the bananas. Peel the bananas and add them to the bowl. Using the end
    of the whisk or a dinner fork, mash them into the batter. Leave the bananas as
    chunky or as smooth as you prefer. If you prefer an entirely smooth banana bread,
    mash the bananas separately until no more lumps remain, and then whisk them into
    the batter.
  - Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Measure the flour, baking soda, and salt
    into the bowl. Switch to using a spatula and gently stir until the ingredients
    are just barely combined and no more dry flour is visible.
  - Fold in the nuts or chocolate, if using. Last but not least, scatter the nuts
    or chocolate over the batter and gently fold them in.
  - Pour the batter into the pan. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan, using
    the spatula to scrape all the batter from the bowl. Smooth the top of the batter.
  - "Bake for 50 to 65 minutes. Bake until the top of the cake is caramelized dark\
    \ brown with some yellow interior peeking through and a toothpick or cake tester\
    \ inserted into the middle comes out clean, 50 to 65 minutes. Baking time will\
    \ vary slightly depending on the moisture and sugar content of your bananas \u2014\
    \ start checking around 50 minutes and then every 5 minutes after."
  - "Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Set the loaf, still in the pan, on a wire cooling\
    \ rack. Let it cool for 10 minutes \u2014 this helps the loaf solidify and makes\
    \ it easier to remove from the pan."
  - Remove from pan and cool another 10 minutes. Grasping the parchment paper sling,
    lift the loaf out of the pan and place on the cooling rack. Cool for another 10
    minutes before slicing.
