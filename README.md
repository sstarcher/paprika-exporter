# Paprika Exporter
Export Paprika data using the API to yaml

# Why

I use this for my website to statically generate a list of my recipes in the format I want.

You can see that [here](https://shanestarcher.com/recipes)
The recipes exporter using Paprika Exporter are [here](https://github.com/sstarcher/sstarcher.github.io/blob/source/_data/recipes.yaml)

The rest of the site uses Jekyll templates to generate the static content https://github.com/sstarcher/sstarcher.github.io/tree/source
